# CTC Guarantee Balance API roadmap

Last updated: November 2023

## NCTS5

[Learn about key NCTS5 dates](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/#ncts5-key-dates).

### What weâ€™re working on now

[CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/2.0) is feature complete and we do not currently plan to add any more new features to the API. However, some of the existing features of the API might be enhanced, so you should review the [CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0 changelog](https://github.com/hmrc/common-transit-convention-guarantee-balance/wiki/CTC-Guarantee-Balance-API-v2.0-changelog) on GitHub regularly.

### Updates

CTC Guarantee Balance API v2.0 will not be ready for use in production until the UK NCTS5 service goes live.
